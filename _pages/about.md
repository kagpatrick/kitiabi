I am an Epidemiologist and Biostatistician specializing in **infectious disease epidemiology**, **HIV prevention (PrEP)**, **tuberculosis research**, and **population-level public health analytics**. My work integrates quantitative epidemiology, geospatial methods, and large-scale health datasets to inform health equity, disease surveillance, and evidence-based decision-making.

I currently serve as a **Data Analyst** with the **Georgia Department of Public Health**, where I analyze BRFSS Asthma Call-back Survey data, SendSS industry/occupation datasets, and infectious disease surveillance indicators to support statewide occupational health and epidemiologic reporting.

Previously, I completed my **PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics** at the **University of Georgia**, where my dissertation examined **HIV testing behavior, risk characterization, and PrEP awareness among U.S. adolescents and young adults**. My graduate training, combined with prior work at the UGA Global Health Institute and Georgia State University, has equipped me with extensive experience in TB transmission analysis, SRHR program evaluation, and applied epidemiologic research.

I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to improve public health outcomes—particularly among vulnerable, underserved, and hard-to-reach populations. My long-term goal is to continue advancing epidemiologic research at the intersections of infectious disease, behavioral health, and global health systems strengthening.
